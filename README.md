# ⭐ Github Favorites
GitHub Favorites is a **compact React-based project** that allows you to search for a GitHub username and fetch their repositories.

You can also save repositories to your personal list and manage them during the session.

This is an independent mini-project that is also part of my *WIP project* called **Modular Utils.**

All modules can be used **standalone**, but they were designed to also work together inside **Modular Utils as a collection of utilities.**


## 🚀 Features
- Search by GitHub username.
- Display a list of public repositories from the user.
- Save repositories to a favorites list.
- Remove repositories from the saved list.
